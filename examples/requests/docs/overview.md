**Requests** is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.

---

**Behold, the power of Requests**:

```python
>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
'{"type":"User"...'
>>> r.json()
{'private_gists': 419, 'total_private_repos': 77, ...}
```

See [similar code, sans Requests](https://gist.github.com/973705).

**Requests** allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, thanks to [urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3).
