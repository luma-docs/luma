# Customize the favicon

Favicons are the small images shown on browser tabs and bookmarks.

By default, Luma uses the Luma logo as a favicon. To use a different favicon, place an 
`.ico` file in your project directory and specify it in your config.

```yaml
name: mypackage
favicon: favicon.ico
navigation:
  ...
```
